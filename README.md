# README
## Disclaimer
We do NOT guarantee correctness of any of the work done in this repo. We just want to provide some additional material to confront with, for the preparation of the exam.
In addition, we'd like to point out that we are High Perfomance Computing Engineering students, taking the exam for 5 credits, so you will NOT find any theory nor exercises on the topics of the last lecture of the course.

## Instructions
### Proposed exam solutions
Each folder has the name of a year the course has taken place.
For each year exam calls each one of us proposed solutions for the first three (or less) exercises.
We do not guarantee correctness of any of the work done since we have been updating this repo while we were preparing for the exam and many exercise may have been done in a manner that later we discovered erroneous.

### Cheatsheet
Each one of use wrote cheatsheet to use during the exams. These are files where we already prepared code to use during the exam according to the exercise proposed. These are intended to be modified as little as possible during the exam so some of the variable names may be a little generic and some code may be repeated.
We highly suggest to create yourself a cheatsheet like the ones in this repository so that you better know how to use it and where to find relevant code snipet to be used in the exam. Of course you can use also ours by downloading them.

### Issues
In the issue section we discussed (in italian) some doubts we had regarding exercises and theory. You can explore this section to clarify some of your doubt (or not) or even find new ones to struggle with.
