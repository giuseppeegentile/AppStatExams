# Jackbranch's Structure

- **Exams Solutions**: I performed several exercises, starting from the most recent ones and going back in time up to 2021;
- **Cheatsheets Folder**: Here you will find the cheatheet files I used during the exam.  
  I'd suggest to go for the complete one (named `cheatsheet_full.R`), as it is easily surfable in RStudio via sections that are inserted to direclty jump where you need to.  
  `exams_index.txt` is a catalogue of the past exams' exercises that I did, subdivided by topic and by date.  
  The _dataset_ folder, as the name suggests, contains the datasets that I used to put the `cheatsheet_full.R` file together.
